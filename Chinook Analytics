#In this project, I downloaded a dataset for a digital media store and its related information.
# I then used SQL to query the data to find various interesting points of the data.

#1. I wanted to see how many customers there where and whether they were doemstic.
SELECT
CASE 
    WHEN country = 'USA' then 'Domestic'
    ELSE 'International'
    END AS customer_origin,
    count(customerid) total_customers
FROM chinook.customers
GROUP BY customer_origin;

#2. I then wanted to see how many albums various artists had available in the store.
SELECT artists.name AS artist, COUNT(albums.albumid)
FROM artists
JOIN albums
ON artists.artistid=albums.artistid
GROUP BY artist;
