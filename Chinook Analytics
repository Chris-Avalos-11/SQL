#In this project, I downloaded a dataset for a digital media store and its related information.
# I then used SQL to query the data to find various interesting points of the data.

#1. I wanted to see how many customers there where and whether they were doemstic.
SELECT
CASE 
    WHEN country = 'Canada' then 'Domestic'
    ELSE 'International'
    END AS customer_origin,
    count(customerid) total_customers
FROM chinook.customers
GROUP BY customer_origin;

#2. I then wanted to see how many albums each artist had available in the store.
SELECT artists.name AS artist, COUNT(albums.albumid)
FROM artists
JOIN albums
ON artists.artistid=albums.artistid
GROUP BY artist;

#3. Next, I wanted to find the number of sales & total revenue made by each sales agent.
SELECT emp.FirstName, emp.LastName, COUNT(inv.invoiceid) 'Number of Sales', ROUND(SUM(inv.total), 2) 'Total Revenue'
FROM chinook.employees emp
    JOIN chinook.customers cust
    ON cust.supportrepid = emp.employeeid
        JOIN chinook.invoices inv
        ON inv.customerid=cust.customerid
WHERE emp.title= 'Sales Support Agent'
GROUP BY emp.firstname
ORDER BY 'Total Revenue';

#4. I then wanted to see the total number of sales and revenue made for each year on record, starting with the most recent year.
SELECT 
CASE
    WHEN inv.invoicedate LIKE '2009%' THEN '2009'
    WHEN inv.invoicedate LIKE '2010%' THEN '2010'
    WHEN inv.invoicedate LIKE '2011%' THEN '2011'
    WHEN inv.invoicedate LIKE '2012%' THEN '2012'
    ELSE '2013'
        END AS Year,
    COUNT(inv.invoiceid) 'Sales Made', ROUND(SUM(inv.total),2) 'Total Revenue'
FROM chinook.invoices inv
GROUP BY Year
ORDER BY Year desc;

#5. Here I wanted to bring up all of the customer data for those in North American countries.
SELECT *
FROM customers
WHERE country= "Canada" OR country="USA";

#6. In this query I organized the number of invoices & total revenue by country of origin.
SELECT billingcountry 'Order Origin', COUNT(invoiceid) '# of Orders', ROUND(SUM(total),2) 'Total Revenue'
FROM invoices
GROUP BY billingcountry
ORDER BY ROUND(SUM(total),2) desc;

#7. I ordered the artists by name and listed their available albums and the genre of each.
SELECT ar.name 'Artist', al.title 'Album', g.name 'Genre'
FROM artists ar
    JOIN albums al
    ON al.artistid=ar.artistid
        JOIN tracks tr
        ON al.albumid=tr.albumid
            JOIN genres g
            ON tr.genreid=g.genreid
GROUP BY al.title
ORDER BY ar.name, al.title;

#8. Next, I wanted to see all of the albums and their media type.
SELECT al.title 'Album', m.name 'Media Type'
FROM albums al
    JOIN tracks tr
    ON al.albumid=tr.albumid
    JOIN media_types m
    ON tr.mediatypeid=m.mediatypeid
GROUP BY al.title;

#9. I then wanted to see the top 50 most purchased tracks.
SELECT tr.name 'Top 50 Tracks', COUNT(ii.invoiceid) AS Purchases
FROM tracks tr
    JOIN invoice_items ii
    ON tr.trackid=ii.trackid
GROUP BY tr.name 
ORDER BY Purchases desc limit 50;
