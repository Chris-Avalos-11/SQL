# In this file, I used Kaggle to download Spotify data on the top 50 songs of 2021.
# I then created a table and inserted the Spotify data into said table. 
# From there, I proceeded to query the new data table with SQL.

# To create the table:
CREATE TABLE bit_db.SpotifyData (
id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
song_key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
song_mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness decimal(8,7) NOT NULL,
liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL )

# After creating the table and inserting the data, I analyzed the data using the following queries.

# First, I organized the artists from most to least popular on average.
SELECT artist_name AS artist, avg(popularity) avg_pop
FROM bit_db.SpotifyData
GROUP BY artist_name 
ORDER BY avg_pop desc;

# Then, I determined which 5 artists had the most songs listed as well as how many.
SELECT artist_name AS artist, COUNT(track_id) AS total_tracks
FROM bit_db.SpotifyData
GROUP BY artist
ORDER BY COUNT(track_id) desc limit 5;

# Next, I found the danceability, energy, and length of the top 10 songs. 
SELECT track_name AS track, avg(popularity) avg_pop, danceability, energy, duration_ms AS length
FROM bit_db.SpotifyData
GROUP BY track
ORDER BY avg_pop desc LIMIT 10;

# I then determined the artists' musical style based on avg lyrical/acoustic/instrumental elements.
SELECT artist_name AS artist, avg(speechiness) lyrics, avg(acousticness) acoustics, avg(instrumentalness) instrum
FROM bit_db.SpotifyData
GROUP BY artist;

# Finally, I organized the artists by the avg energy levels & loudness of their music.
SELECT artist_name AS artist, avg(energy), avg(loudness)
FROM bit_db.SpotifyData
GROUP BY artist
ORDER BY avg(energy);
